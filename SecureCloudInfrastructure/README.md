Folder: Secure Cloud Infrastructure

**README file description:**
The `Secure Cloud Infrastructure` folder contains resources and documentation related to the design and implementation of a secure cloud infrastructure. It covers best practices for network security, access controls, encryption, and monitoring. Explore this folder to learn how to build a `resilient` and `secure` cloud environment using industry-standard security controls.

## 1. Secure Cloud Infrastructure

### Requirements
- Define the business needs your cloud infrastructure must meet. This may include performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and specific security requirements.
- Resource: [Cloud Infrastructure Planning Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/cloudInfrastructure/docs)

### Cloud Provider
- Research and select a cloud provider that best suits your needs. This could be AWS, Azure, GCP, or others.
- Document why you chose this provider.
- Resource: [Choosing a Cloud Provider](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-choose-between-cloud-providers/)

### VPC and Networking
- Design your virtual private cloud (VPC) and define its networking topology.
- Document your design decisions and create diagrams if necessary.
- Resource: [AWS VPC Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html), [Azure VNet Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview)

### Security Groups and ACLs
- Determine the security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) you need.
- Document your design decisions and provide examples.
- Resource: [AWS Security Groups and NACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html)

### IAM
- Set up identity and access management (IAM) controls.
- Document your policies and provide examples.
- Resource: [AWS IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html), [Azure IAM Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

### Logging and Monitoring
- Implement logging and monitoring solutions.
- Document how these contribute to your security posture.
- Resource: [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html), [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview)

### Encryption
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Document what encryption methods you used and why.
- Resource: [AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html), [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview)

### Testing
- Conduct tests to ensure your infrastructure meets security standards and regulations.
- Document the testing methodology and results.
- Resource: [AWS Security Audit Guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/audit-guidelines/), [Azure Security Benchmark](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/benchmarks/introduction)
