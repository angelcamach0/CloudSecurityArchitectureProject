Folder: Secure DevOps Pipeline

**README file description:**
The `Secure DevOps Pipeline` folder is dedicated to developing a secure and efficient pipeline for software development within a cloud environment. It covers practices for integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), implementing secure coding standards, continuous security testing, and secure deployment mechanisms. Explore this folder to understand how to establish a seamless and `secure` DevOps workflow.

## 6. Secure DevOps Pipeline

### DevOps Solution
- Choose a cloud-based DevOps pipeline solution (such as AWS CodePipeline or Azure DevOps).
- Document why you chose this solution.
- Resource: [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops)

### Security Controls
- Define security controls to integrate into the pipeline (such as secure coding practices or vulnerability scanning).
- Document your controls and provide examples.
- Resource: [AWS DevSecOps Workshop](https://workshops.aws/categories/DevSecOps), [Azure DevOps Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/security/security-best-practices)

### Automation
- Develop automation to perform security reviews and approvals.
- Document your automation process and provide examples.
- Resource: [AWS CodeStar](https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/), [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/pipelines)

### Testing
- Test your pipeline to ensure it's effective in delivering secure code.
- Document your testing process and the results.
- Resource: [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/), [Azure Test Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/test-plans)
